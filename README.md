#Simple RISC-V Processor

This project focuses on building a simple computer that implements a **Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)**.  
Here, I designed and implemented my own RISC processor while much simpler than ARMv7, it gave me a strong grasp of how computers actually work.

## Register File Design

RISC processors use a hardware structure known as a **register file**, which is essentially a collection of registers multiplexed together.  

- **Reads**: In my design, register reads are **combinational**. This means that after sending a read request, the value is available immediately after a small combinational delay.  
- **Writes**: Register writes are **sequential**, happening only on the rising clock edge.  
- **Modern CPUs**: In high-performance processors, reads are often pipelined to achieve higher clock frequencies. Since this is my first attempt at building a RISC CPU, I kept the read path combinational â€” leaving pipelined reads as a clear area for improvement.
